# Python Challenge

![Python Challenge Logo](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/logo.jpg)

http://www.pythonchallenge.com is a site that poses a treasure-hunt-like puzzle with 33 odd levels. One level leads to the next. Each requires writing some python code to get a clue to proceed to next level. As expected, difficulty increases with each level.

Some files related to some initial levels attempted as part of the training fun moments are added in this directory.
